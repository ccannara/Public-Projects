OCaml Instant Messager [SAMPLE]

Here contains my contribution to a group project I have done at the beginning of my sophomore year in college. None of the code is executible as is
since more than half the required files are purposefully excluded. The project was an exploration in communication between computers over a server using
OCaml, which at the time had minimal support for any sort of server functionality. The original project allowed communication between peoples and a chatbot 
with RSA encryption included.

Thank you
