Simple C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Reads in text files of "ALIVE" characters and "DEAD" characters defined in
simulation.cpp. These characters can be changed to allow text files with
other characters to be accepted.

usleep() found in simulation.cpp can be changed/removed to run faster on
slower devices.

Quick Hash and Hashlife implementations have yet to be implemented

Compile with: bash compile.sh
Correct usage is: ./sim <file name>
